# Computationally-Efficient-Approximations-for-Distributionally-Robust-Optimization

The available data, results, and MATLAB codes in this project are the exact data and MATLAB codes used in the paper named "Computationally Efficient Approximations for
Distributionally Robust Optimization under Moment and Wasserstein Ambiguity".

The data and results corresponding to each table stored in an Excel file indicated by the table number in the paper. The folder "Problem data and results" includes the excel files of all tables.
