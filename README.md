# Computationally-Efficient-Approximations-for-Distributionally-Robust-Optimization

- The available data, results, and MATLAB codes in this project are the exact data and MATLAB codes used in the paper named **"Computationally Efficient Approximations for
Distributionally Robust Optimization under Moment and Wasserstein Ambiguity"** submitted to **"INFORMS Journal on Computing"**.

- The data and results corresponding to each table stored in an Excel file indicated by the table number in the paper. The folder "Problem data and results" includes the excel files of all tables.

- We summarize the lower bounds of the DRO problem with the moment-based ambiguity set on both applications in Tables 1 and 2, while Tables 3 and 4 report the results for the DRO problem with the combined ambiguity set. We report performance of the upper bound (17) in Tables 5 - 6 and report that of (20) and (46) in Tables 7 - 10. The interval results of the DRO problem with the moment-based ambiguity set are summarized in Tables 11 and 12, while Tables 13 and 14 report the results for the DRO problem with the
combined ambiguity set. We show the results related to the benefits of choosing leading components in Table 15. Tables 16  - 18 report the results of sensitivity analysis with respect to $\gama_1$, $\gama_2$, and $R_0$. We report the performance of lower bound (EC.46) and upper bound (EC.48) of Problem (DRO-C2) in Tables EC.1 and EC.2, respectively. The short description of each table is as follows:
  - Table 1 Lower bound (8) on the production-transportation problem
  - Table 2 Lower bound (8) on the newsvendor problem
  - Table 3 Lower bound (43) on the production-transportation problem
  - Table 4 Lower bound (43) on the newsvendor problem
  - Table 5 Upper bound (17) on the production-transportation problem
  - Table 6 Upper bound (17) on the newsvendor problem
  - Table 7 Upper bound (20) on the production-transportation problem
  - Table 8 Upper bound (20) on the newsvendor problem
  - Table 9 Upper bound (46) on the production-transportation problem
  - Table 10 Upper bound (46) on the newsvendor problem
  - Table 11 Intervals on the production-transportation problem
  - Table 12 Intervals on the newsvendor problem
  - Table 13 Intervals on the production-transportation problem
  - Table 14 Intervals on the newsvendor problem
  - Table 15 Arbitrary vs. leading components on the newsvendor problem
  - Table 16 Sensitivity analysis for lower bound (8) on the newsvendor problem with respect to Î³1
